# Spring Boot 3.0 Security with JWT Implementation
This project demonstrates the implementation of security using Spring Boot 3.0 and JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It includes the following features:

## Features
* User registration and login with JWT authentication
* Password encryption using BCrypt
* Role-based authorization with Spring Security
* Customized access denied handling
* Logout mechanism

## Technologies
* Spring Boot 3.0
* Spring Security
* JSON Web Tokens (JWT) <- not a technology, but a sham. It would be better if we just craete random unique key, encrypt with ESA and store it with db and return as token. DB can handle expiration details
* BCrypt
* Maven 

* JDK 17+
* Maven 3+

* Original Repository: `git clone https://github.com/ali-bouali/spring-boot-3-jwt-security.git`
